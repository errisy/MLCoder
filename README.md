# MLCoder

**An attempt to build a simple coding tool that help avoid typos **

Codes are mainly written in text editor, analyzed and compiled by parser.

Especially for web development, there are quite a few different types of tools such as AngularJS, React, jQuery, etc.

Writing codes in text editor is very painful. Writing codes in editors that have some kind of support to a tool is less painful though, you still waste a lot of time in maintaining consistency and fixing up typos.

I had a plan to build up a small coding tool that can provide customized supports to different languages and plugins.

One popular choice is to "compile one language into another" such as compiling TypeScript into JavaScript. Writing a parser is quite complex and it has to rely on existing code editors/IDEs for syntax and typo checking.

To avoid writing a complex parser, the simplest idea is to build all the views and relationships something entirely in a tree structure, as which can be simply done by WPF.

So here is a small demo for the MLCoder. I will update it when I got more time.

Good luck!
